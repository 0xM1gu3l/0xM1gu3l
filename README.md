For now I'm studying to hack some company that has a Bug Bounty program for receive my first Bounty!  

17/07/23 Update - Some days ago I've received my first bug bounty from Medalhei (https://medalhei.com). A brazillian olympics school  platform! The vulnerability allowed me to dump every user from the platform, with sensitive data, like ID, address, name, phone number, etc... I was rewarded with R$ 250 (~ $50). Looking for the next bounty :D

Yeah... That's all for now!
